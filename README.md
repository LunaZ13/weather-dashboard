# Weather Dashboard

## Description: 
I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard from scratch. The weather dashboard will display current and future conditions for searched city. Cities that are searched are added to a search history, this way the user can always go back and check the weather on past searched history.

## Installation:
Open in browser or click on the following link. https://lunaz13.github.io/weather-dashboard/

## Usage:
See demo and instructions below.

## Features:
1. Click in the input text area and type in desired city, then click on the search button.
    * The city will be added underneath to a list.
    * The city conditions will be displayed to the right, as well as a five day forecast below.
    * The weather conditions will include; temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

2. Searched cities are saved to local storage so the user can always go back to past history. 

3. When the user refreshes the page, the searched cities will still be listed on the page.

## Built With:
